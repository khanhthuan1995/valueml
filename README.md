## Core Concept

### 1.1 Value Investing

Value Investing can be described as follow: 

> Introduced by Benjamin Graham in his classic work The Intelligent Investor Mr. Market is emotionally unstable. At times he feels euphoric and sees only positive things and at times he feels depressed and looks at only negative things. Depending upon the mood of Mr. Market, stock prices rise and fall. Mr. Market constantly fascinates and promotes investors by changing his prices. He will knock at your door every trading day with his quotation and give you the option to trade with hiAm. He will faithfully come to you every trading day,irrespective of whether you do business with him or not.

> Mr. Market constantly titillates investors with a variety of gimmicks such as earnings surprises, corporate takeovers, bonus declarations, grim news about recession,announcements of technological breakthroughs, corporate scandals and political changes.

> While, Mr. Value hardly appears and rarely evokes any emotions. A remarkably solid and reliable person, Mr. Value steadily plods in the real world. As Charles Ellis put it"He works all day and night investing,making and distributing goods and services". His job is to grind it out on the shop floor,at the warehouse and in the store, day after day, doing the real work of the economy.

> Mr. Value role may not be exciting ,but it is extremely important. Although Mr. Market may tickle us all the time , Mr. Value prevails in the long run. As Graham said,the stock market is a voting machine in the short run but a weighing machine in the long run."

In short. 

Investors will buy assets at discount price and only buy at discount price.

That is the original concept. 

We will cover other implementation soon.

Should we applying AI/ML/DL to this field?

There are some ideas that come up with taking ML to predict credit score of the customer. The model works so well that it now become a part of assessment process. Therefore, it reduced the work of processing data and make employee focus on the decision process. 

It is quite hard to predict what will come next in this field. But here are some of application of ML/DL in finance. May be we can come up with a new idea to make the decision process easier or improve the end result of the process which can be measure by performant indicator.
